Easily sell tickets directly from your Wordpress site. Simple, beautiful design. Plugin ensures proper user experience of “Buy Tickets” button.

== Description ==

= Port is a different way to sell tickets. =
Port is ticketing software for selling admission on your website. You tell Port what you’re selling, how much it costs, and how many you have. Port then generates a buy button for your website, so you can put your brand and your tickets on the same page.
= Port is simpler—and cheaper, too. =
Unlike ticketing services that take an extra cut for event discovery, Port keeps pricing simple and reasonable. Oh yeah, and you get paid weekly :)
= Pricing =
Port is only 1.5% + 3% for credit card processing per order (with no per ticket fee).
Buyers pay the fee making Port completely FREE for you
